# Privacy Notice

LxPhisher is intended for controlled awareness simulations. The project itself does not include telemetry collection by default.

## Data Handling Scope

- No built-in external analytics or telemetry endpoints are provided by default.
- Exercise-generated data may be written locally by runtime components in this repository.
- Data written locally remains under operator control on the host system.

## Local Data Responsibility

- Treat all generated exercise data as sensitive.
- Limit access to authorized personnel only.
- Retain data only as long as required for the approved training objective.
- Securely delete lab data when the exercise is complete.

## Third-Party Services

If external tunnel or hosting providers are used, their privacy terms and data-processing behavior apply independently. Review those policies before use.

## Legal and Compliance Responsibility

Operators are solely responsible for lawful processing, consent handling, and regulatory compliance for any data generated during authorized exercises.
